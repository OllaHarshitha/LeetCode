# Parallel Two Pointers : 
It is a technique where two pointers move separately but at the same pace, usually across two different arrays, strings, or linked lists. Instead of using nested loops (which can be slow), this method helps to efficiently compare, merge, or traverse two sequences in a linear time complexity.Let's see use cases
* Merging two sorted arrays into one sorted array.
* Comparing elements in two linked lists to check if they are the same.
* Checking subsequences, like seeing if one string is a part of another.
Incase of 1D Array:
* Finding Duplicates in a Sorted Array
* Partitioning an Array (Move Zeroes, Even-Odd Segregation)
* Finding Intersection in a Single Sorted Array
